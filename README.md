## üß† Philosophy

- To be opinionated on the tools, but not on the code
- To help implementing a scalable, module-based directory organization

## üî™ Directories organization

### src

For a better organization, the code is organized inside the `src` folder, while the configuration files and the `public` directory are located at the root level.

[This is supported by Next.js by default](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/src-directory).

#### src/pages

This folder is used only for routing purposes. Every file inside the `pages` folder should not have any logic attached but to re-export the modules (default for the Component, named for server-side data fetching functions) from the `scenes` folder.

#### src/scenes

A `scene` represents a logical set of screens (or just one) from the application and is formed by:

- One or more ["page" components](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages).
- If they are needed, one or more [data-fetching functions](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview) (`getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`, `getServerSideProps`)
- Other files or folders which are used by the scene(s) component(s).
  - `components`
  - `utils`
  - `*.stories.tsx`
  - ...

Each `scene` can serve to different `pages`, by using different combinations of `page components` and `data-fetching functions`:

- A `scene` could export two different components (or "sub-scenes"), along with the same `getStaticProps` function.
- The two components represent the same information and use internally most of the same sub-components while maintaining a completely different layout (including subtle variations on the sub-components).
- The route "/items/layout-a" could point to one of the components, while "/items/layout-b" could point to the other one.

If needed, a `scene` can contain also other folders like `components`, and `data`... with modules shared across the scene.

If you want, you can place your unit tests and stories at the same level as your code.

#### src/apiHandlers

Each subfolder inside the `apiHandlers` folder contains one or more handlers (which will be later imported by the [api routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)) and optionally the tests, utilities, or any other type of auxiliary file.

#### src/layouts

The layout is formed by a component, along with a function called `getLayout` which will be imported by the scene and placed in the special `getLayout` property of the scene component.

[Refer to the Next.js documentation for more info about the layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/layouts)

#### src/components, src/data, src/helpers, src/utils...

Just use a folder at the `src` level for any kind of file which is shared by two or more `scenes`.

### **test**

You can use this directory for your integration tests with Jest

### cypress

e2e (and/or integration) tests and fixtures for Cypress

### .storybook

Configuration files for Storybook

### .github/workflows

CI/CD and bumping workflows for GitHub Actions

## ü§∑ F.A.Q.

### Shall I use the version bumping manually or with the action provided

#### If you are using already GitHub actions

- If are comfortable with the workflow, just remember not to run the `release` command manually
- If you prefer to bump manually, delete the `bumping.yml` file inside `.github/workflows` folder. Whenever you want to do the bumping, run the `release` script and push your files and tags.

#### If you are not using GitHub actions

You can safely delete the `.github` folder or just forget about its existence as it won't harm your project.
