# TS Next Starter

This is a template for starting a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project based on [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## üß† Philosophy

To be opinionated on the tooling, but not on the code

### What's included

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) (provided by [@swc/jest](https://swc.rs/docs/usage/jest) for better performance)
- [Mock for http req and res](https://github.com/howardabrams/node-mocks-http)
- Two [layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/layouts) ready to be used: One common for all pages and one empty.
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
  - prettier integration
  - [automatic import sorting](https://github.com/lydell/eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort)
  - [Testing library integration](https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-testing-library)
- [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) integration:
  - [linting](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
  - [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) integration
  - [changelog generation](https://github.com/absolute-version/commit-and-tag-version)
- runs linting for code and commit message [on each commit](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
- [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions):
  - linting
  - testing & building
  - package.json & tag version bumping (based on semantic commits)

### What's not included?

- Any styling solution
- Any library for state management, nor for graphql/rest handling
- Visual changes to the standard create-next-app template

## How are the folders in the template organized

### "src"

For a better organization, the code is organized inside the `src` folder, while the configuration files and the `public` directory are located at the root level.

[This is supported by Next.js by default](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/src-directory).

### "src/pages"

This folder is used only for routing purposes. Every file inside the `pages` folder should not have any logic attached, but to re-export the modules (default for the Component, named for server-side data fetching functions) from the `scenes` folder.

### "src/scenes"

A `scene` represents a logical set of screens (or just one) from the application and is formed by:

- One or more ["page" components](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages).
- If they are needed, one or more [data-fetching functions](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview) (`getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`, `getServerSideProps`)
- Other files or folders which are used by the scene(s) component(s).
  - `components`
  - `utils`
  - ...

Each `scene` can serve to different `pages`, by using different combinations of `page components` and `data-fetching functions`:

- An `scene` could export two different components (or "subscenes"), along with the same `getStaticProps` function.
- The two components represent the same information and use internally most of the same sub-components, while maintaining a completely different layout (including subtle variations on the sub-components).
- The route "/items/layout-a" could point to one of the components, while "/items/layout-b" could point to the other one.

If needed, an `scene` can contain also another folders like `components`, `data`... with modules shared across the scene.

If you want, you can place your unit tests at the same level than your code.

### "src/apiHandlers"

Each subfolder inside the `apiHandlers` folder contains one or more handlers (which will be later imported by the [api routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)) and optionally the tests, utilities or any other type of auxiliary file.

### "src/layouts"

The layout is formed by a component, along with a function called `getLayout` which will be imported by the scene and placed in the special `getLayout` property of the scene component.

[Refer to the Next.js documentation for more info about the layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/layouts)

### "src/components", "src/data", "src/helpers", "src/utils"...

Just use a folder at the `src` level for any kind of file which is shared by two or more `scenes`.

## F.A.Q.

### Shall I use the version bumping manually or with the action provided

#### If you are using already github actions

- If are comfortable with the workflow, just remember not to run the `release` command manually
- If you prefer to bump manually, delete the `bumping.yml` file inside `.github/workflows` folder. Whenenver you want to do the bumping, run the `release` script and push your files and tags.

#### If you are not using github actions

You can safely delete the `.github` folder or just forget about its existence as it won't harm your project.
